  BigBrother is a wrapper for ffmpeg
  which configures it to do IP CCTV
  recording & mirroring.

  It is licensed under the GNU Public license (GPL) version 3
  (for the full license see www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)

  It offers the following features:

        *Recording of a live stream from an IP camera in any codec format supported by ffmpeg
	 in an MPEG4 container. Will record sound if camera delivers it.

                *Recording files are automatically segmented into one file per hour
                with the start time of each file automatically aligned to zero minutes
                past.

                *Ability to organise files by day (with files kept until the same day
                next week) or by groups of cameras in their own folder each of which
                could if needed be mounted on a separate disk.

                *Access to recorded files can be provided using a third party file server
                (Samba is recommended) and instructions are provided on how to do this.
                This will allow the recorded files to be viewed using the standard
                file browser on Windows, Mac OS X or most Linux desktop GUIs such as
                Gnome.

                *If a camera stream becomes unavaiable due to a network issue or the
                camera being rebooted, BigBrother will keep trying it until it comes
                back up.

        *Live viewing of cameras using streaming over HTTP and a web browser interface
        The live viewing is referred to as mirroring because it can mirror a camera
        stream from one network to another if desired, for example from a private
        LAN to a WAN for remote viewing.

                *HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) format output.
                
		*Requires third party web server software with PHP support (such as
                Apache HTTPD, Nginx or Lighttpd) to be running on the same host

        *Support for the number of cameras, simultaneous recordings and mirroring
        is limited only by hardware and network capacity.

	*Runs on Unix-like operating systems with a Bourne Shell, Python run time
        and (optionally) a webserver supporting PHP if you want to do mirroring.
        Also requires an intallation of the ffmpeg command line program.
