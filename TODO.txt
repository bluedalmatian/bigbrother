MODIFICATIONS / FUTURE FEATURES TO BE ADDED (IN ORDER)
======================================================

Release blocker		Bugfixes / new features
---------------		-----------------------
			(In v1+) Logfile is chown'ed to bb user after being created but group not changed, would need specifying in global conf file - should be same as webservers group?
			(In v1+) Review & refactor recording dir:
					Look at record by camera - can it be refactored?
					shell script given 2 args: -d /dir & -o user:group creates recording dirs inder /dir and sets owner to user:group 
					Having a group directory under record by day dirs?
			(In v1+) Extract segment from recording web interface
			(In v1+) Web interface to filter cameras shown on mirror page rather than user having to edit URL manually
			
			(In v2+) Group is optional, check event monitoring code in both bbeventmonitor and bigbrotherd accepts this
			
			(In v3+) In order for apache to access log these commands need to be run (this is only an issue in v3 cameraControl.php)
				chgrp cctvwriters /var/log/bigbrother.log 
				chmod g+w /var/log/bigbrother.log
