MODIFICATIONS / FUTURE FEATURES TO BE ADDED (IN ORDER)
======================================================

Release blocker		Bugfixes / new features
---------------		-----------------------
			Logfile is chown'ed to bb user after being created but group not changed, would need specifying in global conf file - should be same as webservers group?
			Review & refactor recording dir:
				Look at record by camera - can it be refactored?
				shell script given 2 args: -d /dir & -o user:group creates recording dirs inder /dir and sets owner to user:group 
				Having a group directory under record by day dirs?
			Extract segment from recording web interface
			Web interface to filter cameras shown on mirror page rather than user having to edit URL manually
